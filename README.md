Claim Wise: Smart Visualizations for Smarter Insurance Decisions

🔍 Project Overview This Power BI dashboard is a combination of my hands-on experience in insurance claims and my growing skills in data analytics. I wanted to explore how data can help simplify complex claim patterns and support better decision-making for insurance professionals.

📊 What the Dashboard Shows The distribution of claim statuses (Settled, Rejected, Pending) across different policy types like Auto, Health, Life, Travel, and Home

Premium contributions by gender and policy type

Average claim amounts by gender

Overall performance of policy types in terms of premium and claims

💡 Why This Project Matters Since I’ve worked directly in the claims settlement process, I knew what to look for in the data. That background really helped me build something meaningful—not just pretty charts, but visuals that tell a story and highlight patterns insurers care about.

🛠️ Tools I Used Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning | Data Modeling | Visual Design

🎯 The Goal To show how domain knowledge can make data dashboards way more powerful. This project is also a step toward my transition into a data analyst role, ideally in insurance or healthcare—industries.
